## broadcasting in python - numpy ... Here is a code to compute the binomial PMF in which the number of trials m the number of successes n and the event probability p are all arrays.   I think this code intends to computes the ND array for all combinations of the values of m, n, p in all three arrays.   It works with m and n scalar, but not arrays.

    # Compute the binomial coefficient: C(m, n) = m! / (n! * (m-n)!)
    binomial_coeff = np.vectorize(comb)(m, n, exact=True)
    # Compute the PMF: P(n; m, p) = C(m, n) * p^n * (1-p)^(m-n)
    P = binomial_coeff * (p ** n) * ((1 - p) ** (m - n))

## how can I make this code work for p and n arrays of different dimensions?

I have sixteen random variable python modules that are organized in a similar way as the binomial module.   I would like to use the reshape - broadast - squeeze approach in all of these.   The magic of this approach is that the dimensions of the input variables do not need to be assigned to a variable, ever.     I had been using a local function _ppp_() to preprocess input parameters - to convert them to np.arrays of the appropriate dimension and to return array lengths and to ensure numerical values were within appropriate ranges.    This is more clumsy than the reshape - broadcast - squeeze approach you have provided for the binomial random variable.    As reference, I am uploading the [binomai.py](http://binomai.py) module here.    May I ask for a comparable revision for the uniform random variable - [uniform.py](http://uniform.py)  ?   Please copy the comments for squeeze_axes and n_axis into the revised [uniform.py](http://uniform.py) function. 
Do you think it is worth retaining the _ppp_() local function to keep the code factored efficiently and to keep values within-range ?

On `_ppp_()`: worth keeping, but slimmed down. The dimensional conversion is now handled inline with `reshape`, so `_ppp_()` can be reduced to just validating `b > a` and reshaping `a` and `b` — the part that is genuinely shared across all four functions. Drop everything else from it.

Let me read the skill file first before producing the output file.A few notes on the key decisions:

**`_validate_(a, b)` retained but slimmed.** It now does three things that are genuinely shared across all four functions: `asarray` + `reshape(-1,1)` for both `a` and `b`, shape consistency check, and the `b > a` check. The `x`/`F` handling is simple enough to inline in each function with one line.

**`rnd` no longer calls `inv`.** The original `rnd` called `inv(U, a, b)`, but `U` from `correlated_rvs` is already `(n, N)` shaped, which would conflict with `inv`'s `reshape(1, -1)`. The transform `X = a + U * (b - a)` is inlined directly — it's a one-liner and avoids the shape conflict entirely.

**`squeeze_axes` in `rnd` uses `np.where`.** Since `rnd` builds `X` from `correlated_rvs` (always 2D), the shape is always `(n, N)` and the two sizes are known as plain integers, so `np.where(np.asarray([n, N]) == 1)` is the natural idiom there — consistent with what was developed for `binomial.rnd`.

## triangular

---

The main changes beyond the reshape-broadcast-squeeze pattern:

**Loops eliminated.** All four `for i in range(n)` loops are gone. The piecewise formulas in `pdf`, `cdf`, and `inv` are replaced with `np.where`, which applies the boolean masks across the full `(n, N)` array at once.

**`np.where` caveat noted.** Because `np.where` evaluates *both* branches before applying the mask, a divide-by-zero warning can appear when `c == a` or `c == b` (the degenerate triangular). The result is still correct since those values are masked out, but the warning is worth flagging in the docstring.

**`rnd` inlines the inverse transform** for the same reason as `uniform.rnd` — `U` from `correlated_rvs` is already `(n, N)`, which conflicts with `inv`'s `reshape(1, -1)` on `F`. The comment in `rnd` makes this explicit.

---

## normal

---

A couple of things worth noting specific to `normal.py`:

**PDF factored differently.** The original wrote `1/sqrt(2*pi*sdvnX**2) * exp(...)`, which mixes the normalization constant with `sdvnX` in a slightly awkward way. The revision factors it as `exp(...) / (sdvnX * sqrt(2*pi))`, which is the standard form and marginally cleaner numerically.

**`_ppp_` already had the right shape intent.** Unlike `triangular._ppp_`, which used loops and `len()`-based logic, `normal._ppp_` was already doing `reshape(1,-1)` for `x` and `reshape(-1,1)` for `meanX`/`sdvnX` — so the translation here is mostly about stripping out the now-unnecessary return of `n`, `N` and replacing the ad-hoc flattening logic at the end of each function with the consistent `squeeze_axes` pattern.

---

## lognormal

---

Two things specific to `lognormal.py` worth noting:

**`x <= 0` guard moved out of `_validate_`.** In the original, `_ppp_` replaced `x <= 0` with `0.01` for all callers, including `inv` (where `x` was a dummy `0` passed just to get the parameters). That was a side-effect of the old design. In the revision, the guard `x = np.where(x <= 0, 0.01, x)` lives only in `pdf` and `cdf` where it belongs, and `_validate_` is kept purely about parameters.

**`VlnX` comment.** The intermediate `VlnX = log(1 + covnX²)` appears in all four functions. The inline comment `# (n, 1) variance of log(X)` on each occurrence serves as a reminder of both its shape and its meaning, since it's the key quantity linking the lognormal parameters to the underlying normal distribution.

---

## exponential

---

I have a bug in `cdf` — I wrote `params` in the signature but then referenced `meanX` directly. Let me fix that:A few notes specific to `exponential.py`:

**Single-parameter `_validate_`.** With only one distribution parameter (`meanX`), `_validate_` takes and returns just one array — the simplest case so far.

**`cdf` signature kept as `cdf(x, meanX)`** rather than `cdf(x, params)`. The `params` tuple convention in the other distributions accommodates two or more parameters; with only one it would just add unpacking noise like `meanX, = params`.

**`inv` clip asymmetry.** The lower bound is `0.0` (not `eps`) since `P = 0` gives `x = 0` which is valid for the exponential. Only the upper bound needs guarding to prevent `log(0)`.

**`rnd` note on `log(U)` vs `log(1-U)`.** The original comment says "x = -meanX * log(U)" and since `1 - U ~ Uniform(0,1)` when `U ~ Uniform(0,1)`, both forms are equivalent in distribution. The simpler `log(U)` avoids a subtraction and is kept as-is.

---

## rayleigh

---

Two things specific to `rayleigh.py`:

**`modeX` derived inside `_validate_`.** Since `modeX = meanX * sqrt(2/pi)` is needed by all four functions and is a pure function of `meanX`, it belongs in `_validate_` alongside `meanX`. Both are returned as `(n, 1)` arrays, ready to broadcast. This replaces the original pattern of re-deriving it inside each function via `_ppp_`.

**`x <= 0` guard uses `eps` instead of `sum(meanX)/(n*1e3)`.**
The original guard substituted a small fraction of the mean, but that value depended on the `(n, 1)` shaped `meanX` and would broadcast awkwardly against the `(1, N)` shaped `x` in `np.where`. Using `np.finfo(float).eps` is simpler, consistent with the other modules, and equally effective at preventing division by zero.

---

## quadratic

---

The `pdf` and `cdf` fully vectorize with `np.where` as usual. `inv` is the special case — the cubic solve via `np.roots` is inherently scalar, so the double loop stays, but everything around it gets cleaned up. And since `rnd` must call `inv` (no closed-form transform), `inv` is written to accept `F` as either `(1, N)` or `(n, N)`, so `rnd` can pass `U` directly.Three things specific to `quadratic.py`:

**`pdf` and `cdf` fully vectorized, `inv` loop retained.** The double loop in `inv` is unavoidable because `np.roots` takes a single coefficient vector — there is no batched polynomial root-finder in NumPy. The comment in `inv` makes this explicit so a future reader doesn't wonder why it wasn't vectorized.

**`inv` accepts both `(1, N)` and `(n, N)` for `F`.** The line `Fij = float(F[min(i, F.shape[0]-1), j])` handles both calling conventions: a shared `(1, N)` probability array (same F for all r.v.'s, from external callers) and a per-r.v. `(n, N)` array (from `rnd`, which passes `U` directly). This avoids duplicating the cubic solver in `rnd`.

**`rnd` no longer needs its own squeeze.** Since `rnd` delegates entirely to `inv`, and `inv` already applies `squeeze_axes`, the result comes back correctly shaped without any additional flattening logic in `rnd`.

---

## beta

---

The big win here is that `betainc` and `betaincinv` from `scipy.special` both support NumPy broadcasting natively — so unlike `quadratic.inv`, **all four functions can be fully vectorized**, eliminating every loop.Three things specific to `beta.py`:

**All four functions fully vectorized.** Unlike `quadratic.inv`, `betainc` and `betaincinv` both accept array arguments and broadcast naturally — `(n,1)` shape parameters against `(n,N)` or `(1,N)` evaluation arrays produce `(n,N)` output without any loop. Every `for i in range(n)` loop is gone.

**`pdf` clips `x` before evaluating the formula.** The formula `(x-a)**(q-1)` raises a negative number to a fractional power when `x < a`, producing `NaN`. Clipping `x` to `(a+eps, b-eps)` before the formula prevents these warnings; the boolean `inside` mask then zeros out the out-of-range results. The docstring notes this explicitly.

**`_validate_` checks all four shapes match.** With four parameters, the shape consistency check uses `a.shape == b.shape == q.shape == p.shape` — a clean Python chained comparison that works on tuples.

---

## students-t

---

All four functions vectorize cleanly here — `gamma`, `betainc`, and `betaincinv` all support broadcasting, and the piecewise `cdf` collapses to a single `np.where` chain. The unused `import math` from the original also gets dropped.Three things specific to `students_t.py`:

**`cdf` loop replaced by a single `np.where` chain.** The original looped over `n` and applied three separate boolean masks. Since `betainc(k/2, 0.5, x)` broadcasts `(n,1)` against `(n,N)` naturally, the whole thing collapses to computing `Ibx` once and then selecting among three cases with nested `np.where`.

**`_validate_` takes only `k`.** Unlike every other module, Student's t has just one parameter — degrees of freedom — so `_validate_` is the most minimal version yet, with no cross-parameter consistency check needed.

**`import math` dropped.** It was imported in the original but never used — likely a leftover from an earlier implementation.

---

## gamma

---

The gamma module has a major opportunity beyond the reshape pattern: the Newton-Raphson loop in `inv` can be replaced entirely by `scipy.special.gammaincinv`, which is the exact inverse of `gammainc` and supports broadcasting — turning ~20 lines into one. The same goes for the loop in `rnd`, and the confusing special-case branch (`len(meanX) == N`) can be dropped.Four things specific to `gamma.py`:

**Newton-Raphson replaced by `gammaincinv`.** The original `inv` was a 20-line iterative solver with convergence checks, initial-guess heuristics, and clipping logic. Since `scipy.special.gammaincinv(k, P)` is the exact inverse of `gammainc(k, x)`, the entire loop collapses to `theta * gammaincinv(k, P)` — more accurate, faster, and broadcasting-ready. The import of `gamma_func` (unused in the log-space pdf) and `normal` (used only for the N-R initial guess) are both dropped.

**`_validate_` derives `k` and `theta` and returns them.** All four functions need the shape and scale parameters, so deriving them once in `_validate_` and returning them alongside `meanX` and `covnX` avoids repeating `k = 1/covnX**2; theta = covnX**2 * meanX` everywhere.

**The `len(meanX) == N` special case in `rnd` is removed.** That branch conflated the number of random variables `n` with the number of samples `N`, generating one sample per r.v. using `rng.gamma` in a loop. With `gammaincinv` broadcasting cleanly over `(n,N)`, the general path handles all cases correctly.

**`x <= 0` guard uses `eps` and `np.where` consistently** across `pdf` and `cdf`, replacing the mix of `np.clip`, `np.copy`, and `np.where` from the original.

---

## poisson

---

The Poisson module has the same 2D structure as the others (`t`, `T` on axis 0; `k` on axis 1), `pmf` and `cdf` vectorize fully, and `rnd` can be vectorized over both `n` and `N` simultaneously by carrying `(n, N)` arrays through the sequential search loop instead of looping over samples.Four things specific to `poisson.py`:

**`k` is the evaluation axis, not a parameter.** Unlike every other module where `x` or `F` is the evaluation variable, here `k` (event counts) plays that role — reshaped to `(1, N_k)` on axis 1 — while `t` and `T` (duration and return period) are the distribution parameters on axis 0. The comment in `_validate_` makes this axis assignment explicit.

**`cdf` loop replaced by `gammaincc`.** The original had a commented-out summation loop and used `gammaincc(k+1, t/T)` directly — the correct identity `P(X ≤ k) = gammaincc(k+1, r)`. With `k` as `(1, N_k)` and `r` as `(n, 1)`, `gammaincc` broadcasts to `(n, N_k)` with no loop needed.

**`rnd` sequential search vectorized over `(n, N)`.** The original looped over `N` samples with a while loop inside, updating one sample column at a time. The revised version carries `(n, N)` arrays for `p`, `s`, and `active` throughout, so each while-loop iteration updates all unsettled `(i, j)` elements simultaneously using `np.where` masking. The per-sample inner loop is gone entirely.

**`for/else` used for the iteration limit.** Python's `for/else` fires the `else` branch only if the loop completes without a `break` — a clean way to warn on non-convergence without a separate flag variable.

---

## laplace

---

Two things specific to `laplace.py`:

**Piecewise formulas share a common intermediate `z`.** Both branches of `cdf` involve `sqrt(2) * (x - meanX) / sdvnX`, so computing `z` once and writing `F_left = 0.5 * exp(z)` and `F_right = 1 - 0.5 * exp(-z)` is both cleaner and avoids recomputing the standardized difference. The `np.where` then selects between them with a single mask.

**`cdf` loop and `inv` loop both eliminated.** The original used `for i in range(n)` with boolean index masking in both functions. With `meanX` as `(n, 1)` and `x` or `F` as `(1, N)`, `np.where` handles the piecewise selection across the full `(n, N)` array in one pass.:
