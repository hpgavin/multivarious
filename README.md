# Multivarious

*A Python adaptation of Dr. Henri P. Gavin’s MATLAB library for uncertainty analysis, probability modeling, and numerical optimization.*

## Overview
This fork contains my ongoing translation of **Multivarious** into Python for use in engineering uncertainty analysis and optimization. The goal is to mirror the structure and behavior of the original MATLAB code while making the toolkit accessible for coursework, research, and reproducible computational modeling.
Progress directed and supervised by Dr. Gavin.

The library provides:
- random-variable modules (PDF, CDF, inverse, sampling)
- stochastic simulation tools
- optimization routines (ORSopt, Nelder-Mead, SQP)
- utilities for optimization tools and visualization 

This project is part of my work as a research assistant in **CEE251L (Uncertainty, Design & Optimization)** at Duke University.
